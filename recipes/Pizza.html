    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pre-made pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Assorted toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, etc.)</li>
        <li>Cornmeal or flour, for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface into a round shape of desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cornmeal or flour on a pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet to prevent sticking. Transfer the rolled-out dough to the peel or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, covering the entire pizza.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings evenly over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the preheated pizza stone in the oven, or place the baking sheet directly on the oven rack.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
